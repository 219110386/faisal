As a foreign investor, I want to expand my business in Saudi Arabia.
I use SuiteCRM in my organization in my headquarters but I have no idea about the rules and regulations of saudi arabia.
I want to employ Saudi employees but I fear that some of them might have language barriers and are used to their local calendar so I want it to have an Arabic language option and the local calendar of Saudi Arabia.
I hired a local to be the regional manager, and he is used to the Arabic calendar and dealing with the Saudi riyal.
I want to have a system that has them. Also, he might get too busy to keep up with the latest news in the market so I need a system that helps him stay up to date with the market.
